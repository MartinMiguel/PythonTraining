Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test execution. It uses the code analysis
tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard library to determine which lines are executable,
and which have been executed.

Runs all:
py.test --cov
coverage htm

coverage run test_pytest1.py
coverage combine
coverage report -m
coverage html
