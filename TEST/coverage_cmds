Using py test

Coverage looks for a .coverage file to read and generate that report for you. Py.test on its own does not create one. You need py.test plugin for coverage:

pip install pytest-cov
If you already have it, then you can run both at once like this:

py.test test.py --cov=sample.py
Which means run test module test.py and record/display coverage report on sample.py.

Run all tests
py.test --cov
py.test --cov --cov-report html

Difference between pyunit and pytest:
